# 🖥️ Operating System Practicals (Full Year)

Welcome to my **Operating System Practical Repository**.
This repository contains all the **OS programs, algorithms, and diagrams** that I have implemented throughout the academic year as part of my **Operating System laboratory and coursework**.

---

## 📚 Contents of the Repository

This repository covers the following **Operating System topics**:

### 🔹 CPU Scheduling Algorithms

* FCFS (First Come First Serve)
* SJF (Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive)
* SJF (Preemptive / SRTF)
* Priority Scheduling
* Round Robin Scheduling

Each program includes:

* Process details
* Gantt Chart
* Waiting Time calculation
* Turnaround Time calculation

---

### 🔹 Process Management

* Process creation
* Scheduling simulation
* Execution order analysis

---

### 🔹 Practical Programs (C Language)

* CPU Scheduling programs implemented in **C**
* Proper input/output handling
* Well-structured and readable code

## 🧪 Sample Algorithms Implemented

### ✅ FCFS (First Come First Serve)

* Processes are executed in the order of arrival
* Simple and non-preemptive scheduling algorithm

### ✅ SJF (Shortest Job First)

* Process with the smallest burst time executes first
* Minimizes average waiting time
